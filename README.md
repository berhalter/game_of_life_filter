# Game of Life Image Filter
This program applies Conway's Game of Life to images, either in RGB or grayscale.

## Requirements
Requires [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/), and [Dithering](https://pypi.org/project/dithering/)

## Usage
Run `python main.py` for the command line version.
Run `python gui.py` for the GUI version.

## Bugs and Future Improvements
Please see the "Issues" tab for this repository.

Honestly, there's no real reason for this to be a standalone program, so GIMP integration is planned.
